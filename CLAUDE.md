# evva — Project Vision and Roadmap

## Important

`v1.0.0` is cut: the SDK v2 arc is complete and the Stable-tier surface
promise in `docs/sdk-stability.md` is in force — breaking changes to Stable
`pkg/*` packages now require a major bump. Experimental-tier packages
(`pkg/ui/bubbletea`, `pkg/tools/lsp`, `pkg/observable`, `pkg/tools/kits`)
may still change in minor versions.

## Vision

`evva` is a ReAct coding agent for the terminal, written in Go. The architecture follows Claude Code in spirit but keeps the moving parts small on purpose: one narrow `llm.Client` interface bridging multiple providers (Anthropic, DeepSeek, OpenAI, Ollama), one `tools.Tool` interface, one observable store fanning state to any UI implementation, one agent loop.

The unifying idea is **one runtime, many personas, swappable UI**:

- A **persona** is a main-tier agent definition — its own tools, system prompt, model preference, and personality. `evva` (a professional software engineer) is one persona. `nono` (a financial manager), `noen` (a math teacher), and any others a user creates are siblings, not subclasses.
- The same runtime drives every persona. Switching personas is `/profile <name>`, not a new binary.
- A persona can spawn another persona as a subagent for cross-domain work — `evva` can delegate a costing question to `nono` without leaving the session.
- Adding a new LLM provider, tool family, persona, or UI implementation is a one-package change.

`evva` is **not** trying to be a drop-in Claude Code. It borrows the harness shape because that shape is what current frontier models behave best under, and it ports tool descriptions verbatim where reasonable so the model sees prompts close to what it was trained on. Where Go semantics, terminal constraints, or evva's narrower scope justify divergence, it diverges intentionally.

The reference TypeScript source lives at `evva/ref/src/`. Treat it as the source of truth for tool descriptions, harness structure, and agent definitions — port from it, don't reinvent.

## Agent definitions

All agents — main personas and subagent kinds alike — share one on-disk layout:

```
<EVVA_HOME>/agents/{name}/
├── system_prompt.md
├── tools.yml          # { active: [...], deferred: [...] }
└── meta.yml           # { as: [main, subagent], model: ..., when_to_use: ... }
```

Built-in agents (Main / Explore / Plan / GeneralPurpose) ship as Go-defined `AgentDefinition` structs. User-authored agents are loaded from disk at startup; the loader merges Go + disk into one registry. `agent_type` is a string, not a closed enum, so external projects can register their own personas (e.g. a future `nono` web service registers as a remote agent endpoint).

The `as:` field controls where an agent shows up:

| `as:` value | Visible as |
| --- | --- |
| `[main]` | `/profile` startup picker only |
| `[subagent]` | Agent tool's `subagent_type` list only |
| `[main, subagent]` | Both — used for personas that other personas can delegate to (the `evva → nono` pattern) |

One schema, one loader, two visibility surfaces. This is also the seam Phase 6 (profile switch) uses to enumerate personas.

## Roadmap

Phases are ordered by dependency — earlier phases unblock later ones. Each phase is one focused chunk of work: Go ports of the reference TypeScript, plus the connective tissue (memory, permissions, hooks) that ties the harness together.

### Phase 3 — MCP support + bundled skills (v2 tier)

Closes the gap with Claude Code's plugin/skill ecosystem.

- MCP server config + discovery; dynamic tool registration as deferred tools (so `ToolSearch` picks them up).
- Port `ListMcpResources` / `ReadMcpResource`.
- Bundle a small set of skills inspired by `ref/src/skills/bundled/`: `/commit`, `/review`, `/security-review`, `/simplify`.


---

## Out of scope (v3+)

These deliberately don't appear in the 0–11 roadmap. Listed so contributors don't propose them as Phase additions.

- **Teams / SendMessage** — Claude Code's multi-agent runtime depends on a bridge layer (UDS sockets, remote control, JWT, cross-machine session forwarding). Premature for evva v1; revisit when there's an actual second agent process to talk to.
- **Process tools (`Monitor`, `task_output`, `task_stop`)** — return as a dedicated phase tied to `Bash run_in_background`. Today no one is asking for it.
- **MCP integrations** (Atlassian, Figma, IDE diagnostics) — out of v1 entirely. The MCP framework support (Phase 11) is enough to unblock community plugins; bundled vendor integrations follow once there's demand.

---

## Project conventions

- All source under `internal/` is private. Public extension points live in `pkg/`.
- One package per tool family (`fs`, `shell`, `meta`, etc.). A new tool either goes in an existing family or starts a new family package. Phase 13c moves the broadly-reusable families (`fs`, `shell`, `web`, `util`, `notebook`, `monitor`, `cron`, `todo`) under `pkg/tools/`; evva-runtime-specific families (`meta`, `mode`, `skill`, `ux`, `dev`) stay under `internal/tools/`.
- One package per LLM provider. After Phase 13b they live at `pkg/llm/{claude,deepseek,ollama}/` and register into `pkg/llm.DefaultRegistry()`. The `llm.Client` interface remains the only public seam.
- Tests live next to the code they cover (`*_test.go`). No parallel `tests/` tree.
- No comments that restate the code. Only comment WHY when the WHY is non-obvious.
- Port tool descriptions from `ref/src/tools/*/prompt.ts` verbatim when reasonable. Diverge only with a clear reason.

Key boundaries:

- `agent` knows about `event.Sink`, never about a concrete UI.
- `tools/*` packages produce `tools.Result` (text + opaque `Metadata`); the UI type-asserts on `Metadata` to render structured payloads.
- `observable` has no dependencies on agent or UI.
- `ui` defines narrow interfaces; implementations live under it.

User-facing documentation (install, TUI keybindings, config file shape, log paths) lives in `README.md`. This file is for project vision and the development roadmap.
